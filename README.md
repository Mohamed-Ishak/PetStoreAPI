# PetStoreAPI
Automate a swagger API using Rest Assured
Environment Setup
1) Create a Maven Project
2) Add all the required dependencies

I Have built a small framework based on this swagger API by using:
   1- RestAssured Library
   2- TestNG for running Test cases

   All the CRUD operations are in one class and you can Run all the Scenarios based on the priority and run it as TestNG Suite

   The Reporte I Used the TestNG report and this is a sample
