# PetStoreAPI
Automate a swagger API using Rest Assured
Environment Setup
1) Create a Maven Project
2) Add all the required dependencies

I Have built a small framework based on this swagger API by using:
   1- RestAssured Library
   2- TestNG for running Test cases

   All the CRUD operations are in one class and you can Run all the Scenarios based on the priority and run it as TestNG Suite
